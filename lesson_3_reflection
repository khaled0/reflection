How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
I can collaborate using git in my private host , but github is easier and more security


On github,When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
I choose work in seperate branch when i work with others in the project , so i can make others see my changes , and dont make the small changes in master branch , but this techniqe slower
I'll choose work on master directly , if I alone in the project , and no meaning to seperate branch because no one will see it , and this will be faster
